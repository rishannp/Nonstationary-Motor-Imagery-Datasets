Data were collected during the interaction with specifically designed interface for web browsing and multimedia content manipulation and during imaginary movement tasks. Alongside these data we also include evaluation reports both from the subjects and the experimenters as far as the experimental procedure and collected dataset are concerned.  |

These patients could no longer use commercial eye-trackers, but they could still move their eyes and used the remnant oculomotor activity to select letters to form words and sentences using a novel auditory communication system. |
